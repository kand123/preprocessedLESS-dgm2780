# DGM 2780 Preprocessing LESS

I chose to create a site for Calm Mind Spa for the assignment to demonstrate my use of LESS. 

My site can be found [here](https://gallant-shannon-727dd8.netlify.com) and the layout I copied can be found [here](http://www.robisonhomebuilders.com/). My secondary page is an about page fashioned after the about subpage found on the same website [here](http://www.robisonhomebuilders.com/about-rhb/).



With GSAP I added just a couple of very simple animations to this project using mouseover events and page load. I am excited to delve into this deeper and learn some more complicated stuff as well as explore using GSAP together with ScrollMagic.
